if u get error : Vite Manifest Not Found

1) Make sure you have the latest version of both vite and laravel-vite-plugin: 
	npm install vite@latest laravel-vite-plugin@latest --save-dev

2) Ensure the Correct type in package.json: Since Vite and its plugins are ESM, your package.json should 
have the "type": "module" field. This ensures Node treats your .js files as ESM files:
	{
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build"
  }
}

3)  Clear Node Modules and Reinstall: After these changes, try clearing your node_modules and 
reinstalling to ensure thereâ€™s no conflict:
  Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
  Remove-Item -Force package-lock.json

4) then reinstal and run : npm install  , npm run build
